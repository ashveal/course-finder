Application traineeship develops the skills and knowledge required

in this industry. This qualification provides technical knowledge

<p>Initially, there is a focus on developing knowledge in the safe
use of equipment and safe working practice. Next, the program
concentrates on developing underpinning technical knowledge,
including: obtaining and interpreting technical specifications,
technical report writing, technical measurement and calculation,
quality procedures and assuranc, operational planning, sustainable
practices and teamwork. Following initial training, the emphasis
will be on applying underpinning skills within a workplace context.
After that, the training will be aimed at basic surface
preparation, then basic surface coating. Incorporated within
surface preparation delivery will be the identification and
diagnosis of material states and identifying optimum methods of
preparation prior to subsequent surface coating. Surface coating
entails the identification of suitable materials, the competent
application of a series of coatings as well as problem solving and
analysis of coatings. Supporting the application of these skills
are areas such as: working in confined spaces; first aid; working
safely with industrial chemicals and load shifting.</p>","keywords":"<p>TAFE, surface, traineeship, training, coating, coat, surfacing,

centres on a candidate's research project.</p>
<p>This is a postgraduate program, you are required to complete an
undergraduate program in a related field prior to undertaking
postgraduate study.<br>

<br>

 It aims to produce OHS researchers who can evaluate OHS
interventions and add to the evidence base for the subject. The
main coursework component of the program is given in its first two
years (the Graduate Diploma in Occupational Hazard Management). The
coursework in the final two years part-time is designed to develop
research skills and support the candidate's research project.<br>

<br>

 In the final component of the Masters program (third and fourth
year for part-time study), candidates examine the context of their
research and the process of critically evaluating OHS
interventions. Candidates conduct a literature review, assisted by
information literacy sessions from the Information Services
Branch.<br>

<br>

 Candidates begin to practice the public presentation of their
occupational health and safety messages, assisted by presentation
skill exercises. These presentation skills help prepare the
candidate for their seminar or conference presentation.</p>
<p>Candidates also analyse OHS students' research projects -
projects that involve quantitative and qualitative approaches to
research.<br>

<br>

 The candidate narrows down their research topic and develops a
research design, appropriate to the time and resource constraints
of a Masters by coursework. They apply as appropriate qualitative
and quantitative methodological skills to their project.<br>

<br>

 With this preparation, MAppSc(OHS) candidates are ready to collect
data appropriate to their research aim, supported by a rigorous
research design.<br>

<br>

 Finally, candidates prepare, under supervision, a seminar or
conference paper or poster. This paper builds on the candidate's
literature review (of the previous year). It is important that what
they have already learned is applied to industry and communicated
to industry. Their seminar or conference paper has to be presented
to an audience outside the University, to audiences such as:
managers, human resources personnel, or fellow occupational health
and safety practitioners. With the help of their supervisor, the
candidate develops a peer reviewed journal article from their
seminar or conference paper or poster.<br>

<br>

 By the end of their final year, the MAppSc(OHS) candidate has
written, under supervision, an academically rigorous minor

enable customisation to different cohorts of staff in order to
address their specific teaching contexts. The design of the program
has also been guided by the requirements of the Australian

moving into higher education teaching.</p>
